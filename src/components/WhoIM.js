              I’m Aidan Lozell, a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science, majoring in Cyber Security. 
              Throughout my studies, I built a strong foundation in areas like information security, threat analysis, and network protection. 
              I’m passionate about safeguarding systems from cyber threats and have gained hands-on experience with security protocols, ethical hacking, 
              and vulnerability assessments. Along the way, I sharpened my skills in programming, cryptography, and designing secure systems. 
              I love staying up to date with the latest developments in cyber security and I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to real-world challenges, 
              helping to protect digital assets and networks in an ever-evolving landscape.
